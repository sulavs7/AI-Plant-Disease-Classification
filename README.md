# Plant Disease Detection and Classification

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning model to detect and classify plant diseases from leaf images. The goal is to provide farmers and plant enthusiasts an easy-to-use tool to identify diseases early and take proper action.

I started this project because I saw the need for accessible plant health monitoring, especially for someone I know who struggled to diagnose plant diseases accurately. Eventually, I aim to develop this into a user-friendly app or website so it can be used easily by anyone.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the PlantVillage dataset, which contains images categorized by plant species and disease type, including healthy leaves. The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing subsets.
